       "[\"AITA because I am forcing my parents to choose between two options they loathe.\\n\\nI (F38) have recently gotten a not great medical diagnosis and prognosis.  I am at peace with it. \\n\\nSo I have sat down with my husband and figured out my will.  Obviously he will be receiving most of the estate.  He has to take care of himself and our kids.  He and I both have decent if not spectacular careers and he likes his work.  \\n\\nMy oldest brother is a gigantic D-bag. He is an addict and my parents have wasted their lives trying to help him. They spent somuch of their time and money on him they had very little formy sister or myself.  I don't hold this against them. I love my kids and I can understand the urge to help them with their problems.  \\n\\nThe real issue is that my brother has abandoned my nieces with my parents.  I tried to get custody of them but I am not a member of their church and my parents cut me off when I left home to get a college education instead of staying home and helping them like a good daughter should.  Their congregation helped them hire a lawyer to keep the girls away from me.  But strangely enough after the girls were out of my reach they stopped getting any financial support.  \\n\\nSo on my will I am leaving my nieces money.  Not for them to spend however they want.  It is only to go to pay for their post secondary education.  If it isn't used for that by the time they are 25 it will be donated to a charity that my parents hate.  It advocates for women and reproductive rights.  \\n\\nI sent my parents a copy of my will so they knew what was coming.  They are the kind of people who would take out a loan counting on money from my death to bail them out.  \\n\\nThey are calling me an asshole for not giving them the money to take care of my nieces. They are complaining because they are going into debt taking care of the girls.  I offered again to take custody with my husband.  If I can have them for two years I know I can get them on a path away from that church.  \\n\\nMy parents won't relent and are saying that they will challenge my will if I leave it like this.  Good luck. My lawyer is confident that I have protected the money.  \\n\\nI just heard from my brother.  He is calling me an asshole for depriving his kids of help and forcing my parents into a shitty position.  I asked him when the last time he sent them money to help with his kids was.  He yelled obscenities and hung up.  \\n\\nMy husband supports my decision.  But a lot of my family is calling me and asking me to help my parents with no strings attached.  \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n#EDIT\\n\\nThanks for your kind words.  I love and trust my husband and his love for our children. We do however have education and savings accounts set aside for them that are only available to them when they are of age.  We decided that before we got married.\",\n",
       " 'AITA for making a PMS / period joke about my dad\\n\\nMy (f17) dad (m44) often makes “jokes” about periods or pmsing. For example, if any female gets upset, angry, or is just in her feelings he asks “Are you on your period or something” or “Someone must be PMSimg”. I’ve also seen him bro it up with his guy friends talking about how hormonal women are. \\n\\nMind you this man has 2 daughters and had a wife (my mom divorced him I bet you can guess why). He also has a mom as well as a sister.  So he definitely shouldn’t say stuff like that. \\n\\nLast night I was at my Aunt’s house (dad’s sister) my cousin and I are graduating on Saturday and we were decorating our caps together. My dad was also over there just to visit with me mostly. Well, he got all angry talking on the phone I’m assuming to a coworker about work. My Aunt asked what happened and I said sounds to me like someone is on their period. Both my cousin and aunt started laughing they know exactly how my dad is. He asked what? and why would I say that? I told him he got angry pretty suddenly so he’s gotta either be pmsing or on his man period? I then started going on about how hormonal men can be to my Aunt and cousin. \\n\\nHe seemed irritated so I told him he shouldn’t make jokes about women and their periods then because that’s exactly what he sounds like. He ended up storming out of my aunts and sending my me a long text about how disrespectful and immature I am, and I thought I was being cute and funny but I’m not. I kinda feel bad and like an AH.so AITA?',\n",
       " 'WIBTA for not attending a funeral on short notice?\\n\\nOne of my dear friends’ grandfathers died recently after a long battle with cancer. The arrangements for the funeral were made while he was still alive (he was part of the planning as well). One thing I agreed to was to help with some of the picture boards and decorations, which I did. I also agreed to say the opening prayer for the service. I was honored to have been with my friend for support when her grandpa passed. It was peaceful but still very hard.\\n\\nThe day after his passing, my husband went into the hospital for what was supposed to be a routine reconstruction of his ACL and MCL. While in recovery, his heart rate jumped and he spiked a fever. He was sweating bullets, shivering uncontrollably, and in so much pain. It all hit within an hour or less and was very jarring. It really scared me because I’ve hardly ever seen him sick with so much as a cold. After some rounds of antibiotics he got better and was discharged. However, we were informed a second surgery was needed because the first one didn’t hold up I guess.\\n\\nHis surgery is on Friday afternoon and the funeral is on Saturday morning. I’m quite terrified to not be at home with my husband while he recovers in case he gets sick again. My husband is comfortable with me attending the funeral, but I’m very unsettled about it. His mother was originally going to come and help regardless but she is now sick with COVID. \\n\\nI’ve asked another friend their opinion and they said it would be very selfish of me not to attend. I haven’t asked the friend whose grandfather the funeral is for yet. WIBTA for telling my friend that I won’t attend the funeral on this short of notice?',\n",
       " 'WIBTA if i confronted my brother about wearing my clothes and make up?\\n\\nOk, sooooo weird situation for you guys. Yeasterday I (20f) caught my brother in my room wearing some of my clothes and a full face of makeup with wipes at the ready it looked like. Luckly he didnt see me so i just went into the backyard for a bit as to not embaress him. \\n\\nNow to be clear, in no way do i think this is a sexual thing for my brother. Hes always been a feminine person and he has confided in me before that hes questioned hes sexuality and gender. \\n\\nWIBTA if i confronted and spoke to him about it? I really dont want to embaress him but if he does want to explore that side i would prefer he ask to borrow clothes and makeup, especially the makeup, that shit expensive lol. All the same I would ask of my sisters aswell, when they want to use my stuff. and maybe i can take him shopping to get his own clothes and makeup if he would prefer that. My main concern rn tho is that i want to make this whole thing less embaressing as possible for him because i know he will get in his head about it. So WIBTA?\\n\\nEdit: Ive taken some advice and kind of assembled a little pack. Im not sure ill give it to him right away or if ill let him tell me first but i want to have it on hand when if/when he tells me. Just some basics, like diffrent coloured nail polish even muted tones so he can work up to more bold colours when hes comfortable. I was able to doordash some makeup supplies that should be good for a beginner. Eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, lip gloss. Basiclly all the stuff it would be unhygenic to borrow. I also have some old clothes that would fit him great along with some actual new clothes that i ordered but a few were a bit to big on me. It was recently hes birthday so i went a bit overboard lol. Ive also cleared out a draw in my room where it can all go. Its just ready when hes ready for now.  \\n\\nAs for deciding if i will talk with him directly or wait for him to tell me, im still on the fence. If i do my rough plan would be to invite him to watch a show when everyones out, so theres background noise for him and hes more comfortable. Maybe paint my own nails and just gentely see if he would also like his done. If he goes for that maybe gently tell him (after the nails are dry, i dont want him to feel trapped) i saw him in my room and think he has good choice in fashion and that if he would like i have some clothes he can have that i think would suit him and some \"spare\" makeup since we really shouldnt share eyeliner or lipstick and stuff lol. Very rough draft to the plan but any suggestions on it?',\n",
       " 'AITA for telling my girlfriend her car accident was her fault and that her driving could be better\\n\\nI (28M) have always told my girlfriend (26F) that she needs to be a better driver. She can drive but she is overly cautious, takes longer than needed to look around when parked, stops completely for a good few seconds at stop signs, keeps checking her speedometer and braking the moment she is 1mph more than the limit etc.\\n\\nYesterday she crashed the car, and claims a semi suddenly swerved into her lane as she was passing it. She lost control and hit the barrier. Luckily it was not too bad and the car is drive-able and fixable.\\n\\nWhen she explained what happened, I told her, I knew that would happen someday and she argued saying that it \"wasn\\'t her fault\". I told her a single vehicle collision is always your fault and that if she had not over corrected, and slowed down gently she would not have lost control or even if she had hit the truck, then it would have been their fault.\\n\\nThe truck did not stop.\\n\\nEDIT: Seems like I am the AH, I will apologize. I really meant to say in terms of insurance. Obviously I know the truck initiated it by swerving. Usually unless an accident is really serious, police do not bother finding the other driver and if insurance does not have that info they consider you at fault in terms of deductibles and premiums.',\n",

       " \"AITA for wanting my tenants to pay for the huge water bill due to lawn sprinklers?\\n\\nOur tenants have been living there for a year now, and they've always made payments on time. A week ago the water company sent them a $5000 bill along with a notice that they had been using abnormally large amounts of water for the past 3 months. Edit: The water bill is in their name and the company bills once every two months.\\n\\nWhen I got there I was surprised to see a circle of tiny lawn sprinklers squirting in the lawn. I didn't even realize our property was installed with lawn sprinklers. I've previously lived there for years and have never turned them on. But apparently they were turned on somehow and have been left like that for months. I didn't know how to turn them off, so I just hired a plumber to shut off the valve to the sprinklers. Edit: I paid for the plumber.\\n\\nIn our lease, it is specified that they will pay for utilities and water. But the tenant said they don't know how it was turned on and that they just didn't notice the sprinklers going off the in the yard for months during the rainy season. Now they want us to foot the bill, because they say it's our fault that they were never informed of the sprinklers' existence. But I know they must have turned it on somehow while living there because I've lived there for ages without anything happening. I don't understand how they couldn't notice lawn sprinklers going off for months without telling us or doing anything. The water company is unwilling to lower the bill, and I think they should pay it, although I might be willing to pay part of it as a symbol of good faith. They told me that their finances are very tight. They are a three college friends in their 20s with no dependents working as very highly paid engineers at Microsoft, so I know they can pay it off when their paycheck arrives. AITA?\",\n",
       " 'AITA for not helping a newly promoted manager learn their job?\\n\\nAnother location of the same store I work at recently denied a promotion to the candidate I put forward stating he was unqualified.  Their new manager doesn’t stop calling me to ask me questions. \\n\\nI work at a membership club store and have been managing their Service Deli for some time.  I have a reputation for producing managers over my tenure there. We are an hour outside of a major city so we only have two locations of this very popular store here.  We often interchange employees and managers from store to store because it’s a smaller city. \\n\\nI convinced my assistant to apply for my same position at the store across town which he did.  He is incredible at his job and had 100% earned it in my opinion. Long story short he was denied the promotion and it was given to a person with zero experience in the area, as part of a program to rapidly develop new store managers. Keep in mind this person has never tried this job, worked in the area, nothing.  they are 100% new to this. The candidate I put forward was told “the position was given to a candidate more suited for the position with more experience.”  Even though he was qualified and had been training for this same job for three years.\\n\\nNow that it’s all said and done, this new “experienced and better suited” manager is panicking and slowly drowning in this very jntense job. She calls me CONSTANTLY, at least 4-6 times a day.\\n\\n“How do I generate this report?”\\n“How do I set up this equipment?”\\n“What’s the procedure for this?”\\n\\nIt got to a point that I grew very frustrated and honestly very annoyed.  My assistant wouldn’t be asking me these simple things, how is this person more qualified?\\n\\nI finally answered a question for this person but followed it with:\\n\\n“You know, I see you’re very busy, but so am I.  Your managers had some grand plan on putting you here with the reasoning that you’re more qualified.  You need to be that qualified person, or they need to help you be that.  I can’t keep doing all this extra that I’m not getting paid for. They need to help you.”\\n\\nI got pulled in the office by MY store manager to talk about it. “It’s not professional, it’s not yadda yadda yadda.”\\n\\nOur company has a very detailed disciplinary system and you can only be disciplined for very specific actions as described in our CBA.  This situation was not outlined anywhere he could see so he basically said I was being rude and unhelpful.  But that was it.  They can’t force me to help and they can’t do anything about me refusing to. I made it clear THEY promoted this person, THEY can deal with their learning BS.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?',\n",

She told me “that’s fine I don’t want to be responsible to be on my own.” I asked why she has a job then, and she basically told me she works to fund her shopping lifestyle. She has the latest phone, gets the newest purses, always comes to work with a $7 coffee, and has really nice clothes. I asked why she doesn’t just budget her money better so she can live on her own. She looked at me like I was crazy… I flat out told her that her siblings would not be smart for adopting her because there’s no reason to be adopted. This made her mad and she reported me to HR. I now have to write an apology memo and submit it to her by Tuesday. Now I’m thinking I should have stayed out of it, but this girl has no idea how the world works.

       " 'WIBTA for charging late cancellations for a babysitting job?\\n\\nI (F26) have been babysitting for a long time, but for the family I’m asking about here for 3 years. The parents both have a job that requires very early morning hours, they are sports coaches and work with a lot of people still in school. I get there before 6am and help their kids get up and get ready for school.\\n\\nFairly regularly they will tell me to come 30 minutes later than usual, often they don’t tell me until they wake up and see they’ve had a student cancel. This means I don’t see that until I’ve also woken up. I understand that’s inevitable in their line of work. Sometimes, they completely cancel if they’ve had enough cancellations, and I also don’t see that until I wake up. Today I was in my car heading there when they canceled.\\n\\nI’m thinking of asking them to pay half what I would’ve made or at least for an hour of my time when they completely cancel last minute. I know they can’t control their students, but I try to budget for the money I expect to get and I also can’t keep waking up at 5am and lose sleep just to be cancelled on. I think it’s particularly frustrating when I’m on the way or about to get in my car. I know they used to have cancellation fees for their students as well, but I’m not sure if they still do.',\n",

My son (5) recently started playing with the neighbours kids. The problem is these kids are monsters. I mean I know kids are kids and my kids are no where near perfect but I have honestly never seen such behaviour. There are two girls age 5 and 9 and they are the most disrespectful children I have ever met. This I can ignore as I don’t usually let them come in the house as I have two smaller kids inside and they insist on either trying to yank my 6 month old out of my wife’s hand smash on all my lizard tanks and pick up and carry my 2 year old around who absolutely hates being carried. But now down to the part that is really frustrating me. Since hanging out with these girls my 5 year old has starting treating my wife the same way these girls treat there grandma and mom. No respect, straight up ignoring her, being rude and just a general sense that he doesn’t have to listen to anything she says. I’m at the point where I don’t want him hanging around with them any more but there mother and grandmother quite often send them out and tell them to come play with my kids.\\n\\nSo here’s where I’m wondering WIBTA if I went over to have a conversation with the mom and grandma about the kids not being aloud to come over and play anymore because there kids do not listen to anything we ask, there rude and disrespectful and it is now rubbing off on my kids?\\n\\nThanks I’m advance!\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nThank you all so much for the advice. I have read each and every response I just had to stop replying as I had to get to work for a few hours and sort some things out. \\n\\nMy wife and I will not be going over there to talk to them unless the kids don’t get the memo after we stop letting out kids out to play with them. I let the girls know today that they are not welcome to just come in to our back yard uninvited and if they do they will be sent home. As for disciplining my son he’s generally a really good kid and so I don’t believe that harsh punishment is necessary we have sat him down after school and had a talk with him about how his behaviour is being affected but the girls next door and he seams to understand why we are doing what we are doing. He is however grounded from going out to play with those girls for a week and if after that week his behaviour has improved we will revisit the idea of supervised visits with them and see where it goes.

       " 'AITA for letting my drunk ex husband in my house?\\n\\nMyself (29f) and my ex of 11 years (34m) separated (mostly) amicably last year. We have a son (9). I started seeing my bf (36m) early this year. \\n\\nSitch: recently my ex was very intoxicated and called me at about 4:30am. This is the time he typically went to work so I thought maybe something was wrong with his car etc. He was very intoxicated and in a bad place mentally, so I lent my ear. \\n\\nHe ended up deciding he wanted to see me and it was a great idea to drive the 3 min drive to my house. Despite my absolute refusal and pleads, he drove drunk to my house. Knowing my ex, I let him in quietly, he crawled into my bed and he passed out within 10 min after some blubbering. I did not lay with him. I sat on the couch. \\n\\nMy son was sleeping. I live in a very small 2bdrm suite. We both had school and work in the morning. I was furious about the whole situation but was trying to do the best for my kid above everything ie. Not have them see a drunken scene with their dad. I left for work and he eventually woke up and left. \\n\\nI told my bf as soon as I saw him after work that day. He was very upset that I let him in the house and this ultimately led to us (me and new bf) breaking up. He thinks I should have called him a cab (which I honestly didn’t think about and yes, would have been a good option although my ex likely would have refused) or just refused him entry. He thinks I disrespected him and I’m the asshole. \\n\\nBackground:\\nMy ex and I really wanted to remain supportive of eachother and have a friendship, and my bf knew and was accepting of that initially. \\nThere were other boundary issues with my ex since the breakup that I was always upfront and honest with my bf about that contributed to this being a big deal. \\n\\nI just need to know if I’m in the wrong here. AITA?\\n\\n** EDIT FOR INFO**\\nI did contact my ex the next day and told him it was absolutely not okay to put myself, our child in that position. \\nBy boundary issues, I meant my ex crossed lines, I set and enforced boundaries based on my feelings and that of the new (ex) bf. Ie. He slapped my ass, and would joke about us hooking up. I explicitly told him these kind of comments and actions were not okay and stopped putting myself in situations where I was around him alone. This type of situation had never occurred before. My ex is not an angry/hostile/abusive person. Just a sad dude who isn’t over me. Bf knew he wasn’t over me.',\n",

I am of the view that it's responsible to see if he has sensitive skin before buying the most expensive, most difficult to obtain product (which he might be allergic to anyways) and do this carefully and that it won't harm him to do so in a careful, limited manner in order to save money on the baby products we buy for him.

She, and her family agree that I am being ridiculously cavalier about my son's health and that if I really cared about him, I would of course only use the expensive option until he were much older.  As backstory, her family has had extensive issues with products causing hives and skin conditions, so I completely understand the caution, while my family has had zero issues as far as I know of. \\n\\nBut that's why I wanted to take a more rigorous approach: use a small amount of a single product, apply gently to a small area like his leg or arm and just wait and see if there's any reaction. The whole idea would be to know if there's anything we should know about, rather than just assuming he's going to be cursed with sensitive skin genes.   \\n\\n\\nBut now, my wife, her mom and sister all think I'm an asshole, and hey, maybe I am, but I genuinely tried to take a considerate approach to this because I do care about my son and want him to be happy and healthy, but I also don't want to treat him like he's made of porcelain like I see so many shitty parents do for no reason at all. \",\n",

He’ll say things like he just doesn’t understand the budget, or that he trusts me to make sure the bills are paid. However, when o have to tell him we can’t afford a purchase right now, he explodes. He gets angry saying that he doesn’t understand where all of our money goes, and that we should make more than enough to have some extra.

       " 'AITA “cheating” to get a promotion?\\n\\nI put the “cheating” in quotes because I don’t think it’s cheating but my colleagues disagree. I’m in my 30s and everyone involved are between 30-50. \\n\\nAbout 6 months ago, our unit VP announced his retirement by the end of the year so the company went into search mode. We recently found out our manager will be promoted into the VP position so now his position needs to be filled. Which brings us to my current situation.\\n\\nI’m single with no kids so I have no other responsibilities except to myself. I really want this position because it’s a visible position and a great stepping stone to my career (as seen by my manager’s promotion) and it’ll almost double my pay. Once we found out about our manager’s promotion, I started to take on extra projects and taking work home. I leave work at my normal hours then work from home until 9 or 10 pm, even on the weekends. All of those extra hours have allowed me to take on harder projects that other people turned down and complete more than anyone else. My manager and the VP have noticed and complimented me on my hustle. My colleagues also noticed my increased production. Last week a work friend asked me how I’m able to do all of those projects in 8 hrs and I told her about my nights and weekends. \\n\\nWord got around and this week during our weekly conference call, my colleagues told me to cut it out. They accused me of cheating because I’m putting in the amount of hours they can’t so I’m skewing the production numbers. I refused and don’t think it’s cheating at all and argued they can put in the same amount of hours. Some said they can’t because of family time and others refuse to work hours they won’t get paid for (we’re all on salary). We spent most of the meeting arguing about it.\\n\\nAm I cheating? AITA?\\n\\nEdit: I didn’t add it to the post because of character limits. My colleagues and I are all supervisors. I have a mentor who’s a VP in a different unit and he’s advising me on the promotion process and steps I need to take. He also told me what to expect if I get promoted so I’m going into this fully informed. Basically my manager worked about 50-60 hrs a week because it was he’s always on call. I can go into more details but it’ll just bore you. Feel free to ask and I’ll update if I see the same questions repeated.\\n\\nEdit 2: This has been brought up many times. I won’t get promoted just because I hustled for a month or two. Management looks over my entire career and time at the company. However, my mentor told me to think of it as having an important project coming up and what will I do to complete it. He said my VP and Manager don’t expect me to keep up the production but are looking to see who is climbing for the open position. He goes on to say with everything being equal (skills, knowledge, etc) there is little chance for a person who religiously work only 40 hrs to be promoted to a position that requires 50-60 hrs. Personally I view the double in pay more than compensate for the increasing hrs.\\n\\nEdit 3: There has been questions about my coworkers and the ones who are most against my extra work. The one “leading the charge” and making the most noise is a lady in her 50s. She’s been here the longest, longer than even our recently promoted manager. We’ve always had a cordial working relationship but she’s been vicious as of late.\\n\\nWe’re all supervisors and are on salary. I know some places require sign in sheets for salary positions but we don’t have such constraint.

Well, this pissed my hubby off, and even though he confirmed that it was only because of her refusal, he started yelling at me for not backing him up, because we have to \"be a team.\" I don\\'t feel like him unilaterally deciding she is grounded is a team to begin with.

Secondly they use real sugar, as opposed to HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and while real sugar is not \"good\" for you, HFCS has been compared with nuclear waste as far its negative effects on a human body.

My nephew and L’s birth mother continue to be in a volatile on again off again relationship, being financially supported by my sister and her husband. They moved to another state in July on a whim, don’t send any money for L or even ask to video chat with him.\\n\\nMy sister asked my husband and I to be L’s godparents and we accepted. We don’t have kids of our own and have sent packages and money to help support L.\\n\\nOctober was L’s 1st birthday. I got a plane ticket to go to celebrate (as we live in a different state). My sister offered my nephew a plane ticket to come to his son’s birthday. At first he said yes, that he wanted a ticket and wanted to return home. Two weeks before the birthday he changed his mind, so neither of his birth parents went to the birthday. To note this was not a conflict with work or money: the birth mother had weekends off, low bills, and makes decent money. My nephew was not working and was offered a plane ticket. They decided not to come. \\n\\nBoth of them are serial Facebook posters, trying to portray a life that is vastly different than reality. On the birthday celebration day, they both made their respective posts on FB about his birthday, how smart, sweet, perfect he was. I also posted some pictures from the party and posted “Celebrating little man’s first birthday with those who love him most.” My nephew liked the post, then deleted me off FB and started texting his mom angrily all night about my post because it implied that HE didn’t love his son since be wasn’t there. My niece made a similarly worded post and he did the same to her. My sister got angry with us saying that we made the posts purposefully looking to get a ride out of him. I informed her that my post didn’t Specifically exclude those that weren’t there as not loving him, and that I wasn’t responsible for how he interpreted + felt about anything I posted. If he took offense to that, that is due to his shitty decisions that have led to this point. My mom and grandma also think I should apologize but I don’t see why?',\n",

So it’s important I get along with them. They are like chosen family to her. I get that. But each time I hang out with them I get creepy vibes from them. Supposedly they are all queer and trans, but I feel myself explaining things about misogyny, consent, and power I shouldn’t have to explain. They are also all much much older than her (we are in our 20s and they are mostly in their 50s.) They all have sex with one another at kink parties. And get mad at me (and her) for me not going to these meet ups or parties. I’ve tried to politely say they aren’t my type. Then my girlfriend calls me “Princess” for having “too high of standards.” \\n\\nThey also talk too much about blood, piercings, and violence for me to withstand time around them. I wish I wasn’t this sensitive. I’m trying not to be. But one just kept talking about the blood/pus issues he had after top surgery at the bar. My girlfriend mentioned at one get together that we will be trying to get married and get pregnant. At this get together, people in the leather family suggested that she use her ex (who is a cis guy in the leather family) to donate sperm. When I said no, I’m uncomfortable. They then offered the sperm of two other men in the leather family. I once again said I was uncomfortable. My girlfriend doesn’t see the problem. She thinks they are being helpful and I don’t accept her as she is. \\n\\nFor context, I go to my girlfriends bio family house. I plan vacations with them and I try my best to get along with them. I am friends with her friends outside of this leather family, but lately she has isolated herself from all of those people.

So when my grandmother dies, because she doesn\\'t have a Will, the default inheritance laws would split the estate three ways—between my two uncles and then me as the only living child of my dad.\\n\\nWell, my granddad died in June and I got his Will in the mail and was... upset.\\n\\nMy granddad wanted to make sure all the grandkids were treated equally,  so his new Will splits 80% of the estate between my two uncles, then 15% between the grandkids, and the last 5% to the great grandkids. So…  97% of the estate is being split between my two uncles and their children/grandchildren.\\n\\nI understand that when the Will was written, the reality was my dad was dead and I would be get  significantly more than my cousins…. and my grandad didn\\'t feel like that was fair to my cousins. But I told my uncle on the phone that if he and his brother were in a car accident together next week, the Will still dictates that their shares be split between their living issue….  So all the cousins except for me would get a piece of that 80%.\\n\\nMy one uncle kept emphasizing to me that my granddad did it so that all the grandkids were treated equally. I don’t feel like it is, though, as I\\'m the only one singled out. I told him I was upset and it didn\\'t feel very fair, but he just kept saying my grandad wanted the grandkids to benefit the same.\\n\\nI am upset that my cousins are entitled to their father’s share but my dad isn’t represented at all and I told my uncle that. I can’t hide that I’m upset about this and it makes me feel like an asshole to bring up because I\\'m essentially arguing I\\'m entitled to more money than my cousins. I don\\'t want to ruin my relationships with my family so the Will isn\\'t something I\\'m willing to fight. But, I really can\\'t imagine ever feeling like this is fair and I\\'m a little worried I\\'ll resent my cousins and uncles.\\n\\nI did get some money when my dad died, but I don\\'t think that should count because its not like my uncles don\\'t plan on leaving their kids money when they die, I just got mine \"early\" because my dad died when I was 22 not 52 or 62. (Also what I got from my dad is not even in the same ballpark as what I would be getting if my dad was still represented in the Will.)\\n\\nWIBTA if I refuse to hide that I don\\'t think this is fair, like my uncle keeps insisting it is?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: thank you to everyone who has replied and shared their opinions but I think it\\'s in my best interest to stop reading and replying as I\\'m still grieving my granddad and this is bringing up some upsetting emotions regarding my dad\\'s death. I love my granddad and like I said, I don\\'t want to contest anything. I\\'m grateful to be included in the Will.',\n",
       " 'WIBTA for siding with my mother about a vacation? [29F/34M]\\n\\nFor some context, my husband grew up quite well off and has seen a lot of the world during his childhood and early adulthood. My family could barely even afford a day at the zoo once a year. \\n\\nMy mother 50F who is disabled and on benefits recently won £10k and wants to go on a once in a lifetime holiday with me and my sister next summer.\\n\\nMy husband is the sole earner as I am a student and disabled, so my future earning potential is also quite low. He makes around £120k per year, sometimes more with bonuses. We have just over £100k savings which we put around £2k into every month. \\n\\nThe vacations my mother wants to do is a cruise that will go to a few countries in Europe lasting 10 days, and is likely to cost around £2500 all inclusive.\\n\\nMy husband says this is too expensive and has asked that I talk her into doing something smaller and more affordable. I tried, but she is absolutely set on a cruise as it’s always been her dream. I understand that it’s a huge amount of money for one trip, but as I explained, this is the first and probably only time my mother will ever travel. It’s a once in a lifetime thing for her and she won’t go without me. I feel as though it’s worth it to go all out so my mother gets to see at least some of the world. \\n\\nHe is arguing that this will take up our entire vacation budget, and means he won’t get to travel next year. I don’t understand why we can’t just dip into our savings this one time and still do our usual trip together. We can afford it, it just seems as though he doesn’t want to spend the money.\\n\\nWIBTA for pressing this further and insisting I do what my mother wants?',\n",

Before that we had gotten married pretty young and were trying for a baby. After a year of nothing we were convinced I was infertile. I then went to a fertility clinic and got tested and found out I was perfectly fine. It was confusing since male infertility wasn’t even in our thoughts. He got tested and that’s when we found out he has a zoospermia meaning he has no sperm. We were shocked and upset and it was hard on us. \\n\\nHe ended up getting a microTESE surgery where they take sperm directly from the penis and we ended up getting five sperms. The doctor said it was a miracle. Three were viable and made into embryos with my egg and we implanted two. One implanted and we had our son. Things were fine after that. We did end up separating and divorcing amicably. I had more kids with my husband. He got remarried recently.\\n\\n\\nHis wife is really kind and nice and gets along with our son well. I didn’t know if they had plans to adopt or have a donor or what to have a family together. I thought my ex was clear on that he couldn’t have any more biological kids considering the test we had done was a one time thing typically. In December they invited me over for a dinner which I thought was nice. It was a catered five star meal, I was wondering why they were being so kind, thought maybe because of the holidays coming up. Turns out they were planning to ask me if I could “adopt” over the embryo we have to them as they desperately want to have a biological child together. \\n\\n\\nI explained that I didn’t feel comfortable having another biological child with my ex husband considering I’m remarried. Also I wouldn’t feel ok with MY biological child being inserted into her and having her be pregnant and birth the baby. I don’t feel a connection to an embryo but I do my living breathing newborn. I just can’t imagine that dynamic. They said that it’s not just mine but also my husbands and it’s his only chance to have another biological child and he deserves to have the chance to experience a pregnant with his wife again. I told them I understand but that I was standing firm in my no. They both cried and I left. I told my husband and he agrees with me and says they should adopt or use a donor or even adopt another embryo someone has up for adoption. \\n\\n\\nI thought the matter was settled but turns out it’s not. They told mutual people we both know who are now in my business messaging and calling me wanting to tell me their two cents on what I should do. Most are telling me I would be a savior to help them have a baby and that it’s not just mine and that if it was the opposite way with me being infertile and us having one shared embryo left that I would want to use it.

       " \"AITA for demanding that my husband pays half of the takeaway food we order?\\n\\nMy husband (40M) and I (35F) have very different jobs. Basically, I make double than what he does and he argues that I should pay for takeaway food, especially because I am the wife and it is my role to cook. Therefore, if I cannot cook, then I should make up for it by paying for takeaways, since he already shares the split bill for food groceries (and rent). To give you a little bit of context, I have just taken on a new role at the start of this month, as a head of department, with 6 new members of staff and a lot of loose ends to tie from previous leadership. We both wake up at 4.30am and while he gets home at around 3.30 pm, I find myself arriving around 5.30pm on a light day. \\n\\nHis job involves food processing and while it is a laborious process, when he leaves his workplace, that’s the end of the day for him, whereas I come home and continue working from home (including weekends) until around 9pm, when I just pass out as I am too tired. For him, home time means 90% being on his phone/laptop watching videos and playing games, making coffees and smoking his cigarettes. I am not going to lie and say he never helps – he does clean the bathroom and hoovers occasionally (once a month) and does the dishes (not without complaining though).\\n\\nNow it has come to the point where a few months ago, while he had one too many drinks, he told everyone at the table that he was ‘investing all his money in my a*s’. This is when I started downloading every single receipt for grocery, phone bills, rent, Uber drives, takeaways, holiday accommodations, plane tickets, etc. all paid by me. His argument is that some of those trips were things that I wanted to do or see (which is why I never reproached anything to him); however, the fishing trip that he wanted so much also came out of my own pocket and I never asked him a dime for it.\\n\\nLast month, as we were mostly on holiday, he only contributed with around $200 towards monthly expenses with rent, food and bills, which again, I did not complain about, as I knew that he wasn’t paid for most of that month. But now, once he is working, he is refusing to give me anything that is beyond rent, bills and groceries, stating that I am the woman of the house and it is my job to do the cooking. I told him that I am spread thin these days until everything is more streamlined with everything at work, and that maybe he could cook every now and then or heat some ready-made food (microwave or oven), but he asked me what was the point of him getting married if he was going to do the cooking himself?\\n\\nSo, AITA for wanting the bills to be shared equally, if both of us are eating? Also, not one single time when I asked him about ordering, did he mention the fact that I would have to pay for all of it. In certain instances, he was even the one asking me to order food.\\n\\nEDIT: Having read the post that was shared here earlier, I noticed a few differences though. They were both going 50-50 for everything, including holidays, plane tickets, etc. I paid this summer alone around $3000 of my own money, and he didn't contribute with anything - I didn't even ask him to. Also, 90% of the clothes and shoes he has, I buy them for him, which I don't think was the situation where the wife had to max out her credit cards. I only pointed out the half split when he started keeping the money to himself, rather than contributing to shared things (only because I thought I was being taken advantage of). Whenever he has some money, he will spend it on some fishing gear (which he already has plenty of) or other gadgets. I, on the other hand, put money into a savings account which will go towards a house for us, whenever there will be enough for a deposit. I am not trying to play the victim card, but rather to understand if it should be me paying for the takeaways to compensate for the fact that I don't have time to cook.\\n\\nEdit #2: For those wondering why we have separate finances, it is because whenever he had access to some money, he just spent it on boilies, twisters, baits,etc. (Trust issues - red flags - I know). Also, for those wondering why I am still with him or what I get out of this marriage, it's simple - I love him. I suggested counselling, but he laughed in my face, saying I'm crazy and he doesn't need someone else to tell him what to do, when he already knows what he wants. I will suggest the 1/3-2/3 split for all shared bills though. Not sure what to do about holidays and other expenses though... I feel that he will still expect me to pay for those, so we'll need to sit down and have a long conversation about expectations.\\n\\nEdit#3 - and hopefully the last one. Having spoken to him, we decided that moving forward, he will pay 1/3 of everything shared and I would pay the rest, but he will have to cook around three times a week during the week (I cook during weekends anyway). As for the rest, I think he is reconsidering his views about gender roles, as I've shown him what everyone has been saying here. Thank you kindly, especially to those who took their time to give me suggestions and say something helpful.\",\n",

       " \"AITA for throwing out my boyfriend's medication\\n\\nNeither my boyfriend (25M) or I (25F) are medical professionals or in anything related to healthcare. He found an old, unfinished bottle of antibiotics which were prescribed to him by his doctor a few months ago. He is no longer sick- it was not a very serious illness and he recovered fine. He does not currently have symptoms of any other illness. Without consulting his doctor, he decided that it would be a good idea to just finish taking the rest of the antibiotics now because why not, it'll be preventative of other illness.  \\n\\n\\nI think this is stupid. Based on what I've read/heard about antibiotics best practice, you should always finish your full prescription even if you start to feel better within the prescribed timeline. The reason for this, as I understand, is because while you might feel better you might still have some lingering stuff going on. Not doing so is bad because it can allow the disease to grow resistant to the antibiotics. \\n\\nSo to me, my boyfriend has already committed one error by not finishing these in the first place. And now he is just making it worse by taking antibiotics he has 0 need for now.\\n\\nHe insists he should take them. A day or two after we argued about whether he should finish the antibiotics or not-  I saw them in the bathroom. I threw them out since I think he's just misusing medicine at this point and only harm will come of it. He was angry when he discovered the antibiotics were missing.\\n\\nI think I might be TA because it's not my medication, it's his and it is probably not actually a big deal. One human being an idiot about medication will not create the next superbug, so throwing it out was maybe an overstep on my part.  \\nAITA for throwing out his medication?\",\n",
       " \"WIBTA if I report my work collegue?\\n\\nHi all, second time poster, helped me the 1st time, figured why not try it again. Also, English is not my first language.\\n\\nSo, I (27F) work in the male dominated industry, the company I work for has a lot of extra activities for employees, like sports. \\n\\nI was lucky to work from home for the past year since I have kinda bad anxiety around people I don't know and I'm absolutely terrified of being touched by strangers (like nervous stomach type), but I really love playing sports so I'm regular in the gym and on some of the sports activities company offers. Also, worth of mentioning that some of my good friends work in the same company and attend same events and activities and I'm absolutely sticking with them.\\n\\nThe issue starts where some of the colleagues started contacting me through the company channels in the work time, usually asking me about which sports I played and where (I figured that they're just making friends since we're colleagues after all and I WFH), but I was so wrong since some of those colleagues started writing semi-sexual messages at first and I was giving them the benefit of the doubt since they're married with small kids or engaged so I mostly ignored them or stated that their behavior is disgusting (not US, so the culture is very familly oriented). Even my friends and I condemned his sexual comments multiple times during the activities, especially because he's like 10-15 years older then us.\\n\\nSo, during one of the games, that colleague had a medical issue and since I usually bring the first aid with me and know how to treat wounds, I ran up to him to try and help him (would do that to anyone). During that time he made few sexual comments and connotations which made me disgusted and friends and I called him out for that.\\n\\nMain issue is that a colleague sent a mail to all of the employees praising me for helping him during the sports game. If I may say that email was full of sexual conotations and it made me disgusted to the core, concerning the nature of the messages I received from that person and his previos behavior. I'm not sure what triggered him to behave that way or to do so, but he went out of his way to do this in front of the whole company. Even my friends reached out to point out how sly and sexual it was. I spent the rest of the day crying and deeply disturbed. So WIBTA if I report him to the HR? This is not his first offense so he may be fired, he has a small child and i think his wife is SAHM, so I'm doubting myself a lot.\",\n",
       " 'AITA for refusing to return a rehomed cat I adopted?\\n\\nHello Reddit.\\n\\nFive months ago I (27f) took in a cat, Mina (5f). Mina belonged to my younger sisters friend, who I’ll call H, who was moving to another city/state with her boyfriend. They weren’t able to take Mina with them, and H needed to rehome Mina.\\n\\nI have a cat, Atlas (7m) who is very chill so I offered to take in Mina. H was very grateful, and Mina was very anxious when I first got her, but she’s since come out of her shell and bonded with both me, Atlas, and my girlfriend. She’s turned into a lap kitty and is gradually becoming more social (she used to hide from guests/strangers when we had people over).\\n\\nH recently announced she and her BF have broken up and she’s moved back to town. She’s currently living with her mom while she looks for an apartment. H contacted me and asked for Mina back since it’s “been only a few months.”\\n\\nI told her no, since everyone has grown attached to her and invested a lot of time and money into her transition into our lives. To me, “rehomed” means “up for adoption;” there’s no changing your mind in 5 months. Mina now sleeps in bed with us and we’ve been trying to harness train her to go on walks with Atlas. We’ve also taken her to our vet, bought new water bowls, cat beds, more cat trees etc for her. And if anyone has introduced two adult cats to each other you *know* how difficult it can be. It took two months before Mina and Atlas could be in the same room for extended periods, but now they’ll sleep near each other and groom one another.\\n\\nH was obviously not happy with my response. She said she had Mina for years while we only had her a couple months, and that she’ll pay me back/buy all the stuff we got for Mina. I told her it’s not just about the cost, but also our attachment to her and vice versa. I don’t think it would be fair to put Mina through another stressful transition right after she got used to her new home/family. (We’re not a long-term boarding facility!)\\n\\nH is angry and has even vaugely insinuated going court, which I 100% do not believe she can/will do. But she’s also been talking s*** to my sister, who is now also upset with me and is giving me the silent treatment, and I’m now the bad guy to them and who knows how many other people H has told.\\n\\nI won’t be giving Mina back; but I’m starting to feel like an ahole and “cat thief” as H has said.\\n\\nEDIT: thanks everyone for the kind words! It’s made me feel a lot better. And no, there was no agreement that H could take Mina back; this was strictly a rehoming situation, not a foster.\\n\\nJust to clear up some confusion I’ve seen in the comments:\\nMina = Cat | \\nH = person (my sisters friend/Mina’s previous owner)',\n",

       " 'AITA because I didn’t want to split the bill evenly\\n\\nMy group of friends and I (7 girls in total) are spending the weekend together. Yesterday we went to a winery, and I am not a big fan of wine, while others in the group love it. Because of this, I only ordered 2 glasses of wine. Other girls in the group ordered multiple Grolsches (1L) and bottles of wine, wine flights and multiple glasses. We also shared some appetizers. Before the bill came I said that I didn’t want to pay for all of their wine since I only had my 2 glasses. When the bill came, my friend told everyone they owed $75. I reminded her again that I didn’t want to pay for all of the wine they ordered and she said in a condescending tone, “Oh, I didn’t know we were like that. It’s weird to not split the bill, but okay.” \\n\\nI’ll admit that I’m sensitive to rejection and shame, but the others at the table could tell how awkward this was and that she was truly annoyed. While they went to the outside bar, I stayed in the main building for a bit just to collect myself so that it wouldn’t turn into a scene. However, when we got home she brought it up again passively saying, “Yeah, since (my name) doesn’t want to pay the bill.” This is where I stood up for myself and asked why it bothered her so much that I didn’t want to pay for drinks that I didn’t even have and she basically said that she just thinks it’s weird to go out with a group and not split the bill evenly. She’s saying all of this in a tone that is clearly talking down to me. I told her that it’s fine that she feels that way, but it’s not fine to make me feel badly about it and to shame me in front of other people about it. She kept telling me that she thinks it’s weird and that I “do this all the time”, but we have gone out to eat 3 days in a row now where I had no problem splitting the bill evenly because everyone shared everything/most things those nights. She then asks another girl in the group “I think it’s weird, don’t you?” To which that girl said “yeah it is.” \\n\\nThis made me feel alienated and embarrassed and I started to get emotional. I know that I’m an emotional person, which I carry a lot of shame because I tend to be around people who are the complete opposite. I get that people have different opinions and etiquette, but I disagree with shaming people because you don’t agree with them. \\n\\nSome context; I grew up in a 4 person family living in a one bedroom apartment and on food stamps for a while. I also work in healthcare and make the least amount of money while all my friends have corporate jobs where they make much more than I do. \\n\\nSo, am I the asshole for speaking up about not wanting to pay for all of my friends’ wine at the winery when I only had 2 glasses?\\n\\nEDIT TO ADD INFO: The winery had it posted on their menu: “ONLY ONE CHECK PER TABLE”.',\n",
       " 'AITA for telling my boyfriend that he wouldn’t be the person I called if I had an emergency?\\n\\nI (28f) and my boyfriend (26m) have been together for 2 and a half years, living together for 2 years. A couple of days ago we got into argument because I told him that he wouldn’t be the person I called if I had an emergency. \\n\\n   A little background on why I said this. He used to be the person I called if I had an emergency but every single time I have called him he has let me down. I called him when I found out I needed surgery on my knee and asked if he could take me and pick me up. He told me that work was more important.  When I went into anaphylactic shock I called him and again work was more important and my boss and one of my coworkers left work to take me to the hospital and stayed with me the whole time. When my brother passed away I called him for emotional support and all he said was that sucks. Lastly this summer by back window on my car literally exploded when I was driving with my daughter, I called him and he said he didn’t know what I expected him to do and hung up the phone. I called my boss again who came and helped me. \\n\\n   When I told him this he said it was mean and hurtful and asked me how he isn’t there for me. I told him all the things I mentioned above. He then asked me how I’ve ever helped him when he had an emergency.  I brought up giving him a place to live when he almost became homeless, dropping everything when he got into a car accident and driving around to get him the parts he needed to fix his car, giving him my old car to drive after another car accident ( he also got into an accident in my old car), giving him my old iPhone when he dropped his into a lake and couldn’t afford to get a new one and giving him money when he doesn’t have enough to cover his bills. I’m also the one who pays for all the house hold needs like bills, food and anything else that’s needed. I also do 95% of the cleaning and all of the cooking. \\n\\n   After telling him all this he said that me not texting him in the morning is the same thing as him not showing up for me in emergency situations and that his job is more important that I am to him. We’ve barely talked since the fight and are sleeping in different beds. \\nSo AITA for telling him that he’s not the person I would call anymore if I need help?\\n\\nEdit or add: so this got more comments than I thought it would in a short amount of time. I thought I would maybe get like 10 max. I do have a skewed view on what a “good” relationship should be since my only other serious relationships where extremely abusive. So my view point for a long time was well if he’s not screaming at me and hitting me it’s not a bad relationship. \\n   Im leaving the country in about a week for a vacation and my plan is to have him full move out while I’m gone.  I don’t think after this I will try to be in another relationship for a while and work on building up my view of myself and being kinder to myself.\\n\\nEdit #2: a lot of people are asking why I stayed so long. It’s not like he’s Satan. I recently had to move out of my old home cuz the HOA was legit insane. He moved all the big stuff and boxes by himself to the new house. He fixed the roof when it had water damage. He does contribute just not enough. He also treats my daughter amazingly. None of our fights have ever been in front of her or anywhere that she can hear. He takes her fishing ( which I know to most wouldn’t seem like a lot but she loves fishing more than anything). He is just not emotionally or financially supportive to me which is big issue. I wish him literally all the best in life. I think he has a lot more growing to do than I do and we are creating an unhealthy cycle of feeding of each other and not getting what we need individually out of this relationship.',\n",

He joined our space with a whole heap of sob stories that everyone else in the group ate up like it was the last dinner they\\'d ever have. Soon he was trying to change the project. Not tiny changes.

       " 'AITA for saying it’s my wife’s fault that my slacks didn’t get packed for my work trip?\\n\\nHi, first time poster. My wife (30F) and I (31M) have been married for about 7 years now. I decided to go on a last minute work trip which caused me to have to book flights, hotel, etc. late at night and then fly out the next day. I needed new work slacks for the trip since I’ve primarily been working from home in my current company, so we had to make a late night run to the local Walmart to get a few pairs. We also got some button up shirts. When we got home I had some stuff to finish up with the planning so I asked my wife to wash my new clothes so that my shirts weren’t so wrinkly. I handed her the shirts to wash separately and put the pants in the dirty laundry. \\n\\nWhile they washed she packed my suitcase and then added the shirts when they were done. When it came time to leave, I verified everything was packed by asking her if she packed my pants. She said yes.\\n\\nCue to late the next night when I arrive at my hotel and my slacks aren’t in there—only my brown khakis and gray khakis. I called her pretty upset asking where my slacks were. She got defensive and told me she thought she packed all my clothes (I had laid them out on the bed besides the stuff to be washed) and told me they should be in there. I made her check the laundry room to be sure and she looked around the whole house before finding them in our bedroom laundry basket unwashed. \\n\\nI repeated a few times how I was frustrated that she hadn’t packed them but had told me that she did. She said she didn’t realize by “pants” I meant my slacks and that she was busy trying to do other stuff and just had a memory of packing some pants with all the other things I had laid out. She also said it was unreasonable for me to be upset with her when they are my pants and she didn’t think she was expected to do a whole second load of laundry at midnight.\\n\\nIn the end she attempted to make me feel better by saying that it would be okay and my work would understand that sometimes things get a bit hectic with packing and traveling last minute (and I can buy more in the evening hopefully). I feel kind of bad cause I could tell she was frustrated with me for blaming her, but in my defense I did ask her if she had packed everything.\\n\\nEdit/Update: I accept that IATA and have apologized to my wife. She responded graciously and told me she knows a lot of it was just my stress from traveling and worrying about work. We are good now and I promised to do better in the future. Thanks to everyone who engaged with me civilly in the comments. I showed my wife the post and she wants to say that she is a little surprised at how angry everyone else was (she says she was frustrated but knew it’s not a pattern), especially some individual messages that some very angry people decided to send me.\\n\\nTL;DR my wife forgot to pack my slacks for a work trip and I was frustrated with her over the phone so we argued.

We started off as friends but it grew into a beautiful partnership. He\\'s the most understanding and supportive person in my life and one of my biggest priorities as I am his.\\n\\nI also have this group of friends since high school, I\\'ll give fake names for the sake of the post. It\\'s Rania, Mary and Becky. Ever since I started dating my husband they\\'ve always tried to make our friendship vs my relationship into a competition on which is more important to me to which I always replied that I don\\'t like comparing and putting hierarchy on that stuff because each relationship serves a different purpose on my life. I adore my friends and they\\'ve been extremely supportive yet I\\'m not as close to them as I have been to my husband but still I think it\\'s wrong to go to their face and compare the love I have for each of them.\\n\\nOur families also have this concept of \"family always comes first\" and while our families do love each other, at some points they\\'d throw in their true perspective of how his family considers me an outsider and my family considers him an outsider and would guilt us into putting them over our partner. All in all people in our lives always tried to make our relationship an importance competition while we never put each other in that position.\\n\\nSo at our wedding reception during our speeches he called me his greatest love and I called him the most important person in my life and my greatest love. To which our families and *my* friends took great offence.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been bombarded with guilt tripping words from our families of how wrong it is for us to put each other first and consider e/o the most important person and \"tossing our families to the side\". And my friends said how harmful it is for me to lie for so long about not wanting to put hierarchy and compare the loves I have for friends/partner/family just to publicly announce how my husband is my greatest love. Maybe I am ta for putting that part in the speech because it hurt people around me and caused offense and controversy.',\n",
       " 'WIBTA if my engagement ring had my sister’s birthstone in it?\\n\\nMy partner (34M) and I (32F) have been together for 2.5 years and are planning on getting engaged soon. I don’t know when/where he’ll pop the question, but sometime in 2023. He’s been very upfront that he wants me to have as much input as possible on my engagement ring, and we’re working with a company that designs/makes custom rings. \\n\\nHere’s where my dilemma comes in: I’ve never wanted a diamond ring. (I understand the classic appeal, and diamonds are gorgeous, it’s just not for me!) Instead I want a sapphire ring. Blue is one of my favorite colors, and I have bright blue eyes. My partner also says that my eyes are what he noticed first about me and he regularly tells me how much he loves them. Whenever I imagine my wedding day, I’m wearing a sapphire ring. \\n\\nWhen we were visiting my family for the holidays, my mom asked about the ring, and I told her that we were still working on a design, but that it’d be a sapphire. My older sister (35F) overheard this and lost it. Sapphire is her birthstone, and throughout our childhoods, we always got color-coordinated stuff. Blue for her, red for me (garnet is my birthstone). Like if we got sweaters, mine would be red and hers would be blue. I’ve never really liked red, but that’s just the way it was.\\n\\nMy sister said that she couldn’t believe that I was considering a sapphire ring, when I knew it was HER birthstone. She told me I was pathetic and attention-seeking for getting a non-diamond ring, and that I should know that blue is her color. She said that everyone in the family will think it’s weird and inappropriate for my engagement ring to have her birthstone. \\n\\nFor some extra info, my sister doesn’t wear sapphire jewelry with any regularity and she got married four years ago. Her engagement ring and wedding band both have diamonds, so it’s not like I’m “stealing” sapphires or a ring idea from her. \\n\\nWIBTA for going with my original/dream ring, even if it pisses off my sister?\\n\\nTLDR: I want a sapphire engagement ring. Older sister says that because it’s her birthstone, I can’t.\\n\\nETA: Lots of people commenting/asking if my sister hates on other people having sapphire jewelry. Nope! Not that I know of. I think it’s just *my* ring that’s the problem. Also, I know that this is a minor issue and seemed like a no-brainer to me. My sister and I don’t have the best relationship, and her vehemence really got in my head a bit, hence my post.',\n",

My Dad left Judaism and got married to my Mom and they became Jewish Christians. Almost his whole family went no contact because of that, except for my aunt. We talked a lot even though we lived far and one of the things we talked about when I got older was gardening. Gardenias were her favorite flowers and I'd always email her photos of the gardenia bushes outside my house. She was the only one from my Dad's side of the family who called when my Dad passed away. \\n\\nFor Orthodox Jews, they don't put up a tombstone for a year and then have an unveiling ceremony that the family attends. When my aunt died her children and other family basically forbade my brother and I from joining in mourning rituals and completely ignored us during the funeral and prayer services. They wouldn't even count my brother for the prayer quorom and chose to use a random person they called instead. \\n\\nFor the unveiling, I decided to bring some cuttings from my gardenia bushes to lay on the grave and do a small prayer after the ceremony. When I showed up with the flowers no one said anything, and after the ceremony was done and everyone drifted away I put them over the grave and said a small prayer for her. Over comes my uncle who has said maybe 20 words to me my whole life and he picks them up and tosses them and starts shooing me away from the grave.

I do this with other languages too, If I’m speaking French and I have to say an English name or place I say it as it makes sense in the language even if I know the “correct” way. My favourite is when I have to say “Wocestershire sauce” in a foreign language, it sounds funny.\\n\\nSo as I stated above, my sister’s BF was there too and he started “correcting me” to show me how to pronounce the player’s names  correctly (he got them all wrong), I didn’t say anything the first few times because I was just enjoying the match, but then he became so annoying correcting me at every German word I said. He didn’t know I speak German, I speak 4 languages but I don’t usually go telling everyone, so as I was tired of his behavior, I told him:\\n\\n*Ich hatte keine Ahnung dass Du Deutsch sprichst, Velleicht Können Wir einmal üben damit Du mir helfen Kannst, meine Aussprache zu verbessen.* Which means: *I had no idea you speak German, maybe we get to practice once so you help me improve my pronunciation.* I know my German isn’t perfect but I certainly know way more than him.\\n\\nHe didn’t get a word because he doesn’t speak the language and my sister looked at me pissed, so our other friends started laughing at him and he seemed really pissed, my BF (who was also tired of his attitude and comes from Austria btw) started speaking German to me and we exchanged some words. The match ended and everyone left, he also left but my sister was mad at me for humiliating him and she told me that he was mad because I should’ve told him I speak German so he wouldn’t have looked like a loser.\\n\\nI swear, I didn’t do it to humiliate him, I was just tired of his attitude and wanted him to stop and I thought it was the only way (it worked) but I’m also refusing to apologise as my sister wants me to because he is the one who started this was him.',\n",

My husband then said he would come over and bring her himself, to which she was very thankful.\\n\\nMy husband then came to me and asked where my daughter's phone was, I said it was in her room and asked why.

James and I both gave short speeches to our families, and in mine, I mentioned that I was lucky to have been blessed with two soulmates. Which apparently was the wrong thing to say, because I was later pulled aside by Matt's mother to say that she was hurt by what I said and that Matt would be 'rolling around in his grave' if he'd heard.

One of the showers is even bigger than the other, and has a seat that you can sit on. \\n\\nNow, on Mondays I have class from 8 am to 7 pm with only small breaks in between, so I\\'m usually exhausted by the time I come back after class and dinner. When I get really tired, my left shin starts hurting BADLY. Like, a bone deep pain that doesn\\'t get worse or better until I sleep it off. Anyways, last week my Monday was even worse because of events other than my classes, and my leg started hurting around 5 pm. Two hours later it was still hurting badly, but I managed to quickly eat and come back. I was going to shower and go to bed. I decided to use the biggest shower in the disabled bathroom, because I needed to sit on the seat. Anyways I\\'m sitting there and showering, when someone knocks really loudly on the bathroom door. I said that I would be out in a minute, and conitnued to shower, but they continued to knock. So I finished up my shower quickly, put on my towel, and opened the door. \\n\\nThere was this one girl there and our RA. The girl looked really mad, and she basically started shouting at me for using the disabled shower when I wasn\\'t disabled. The RA just looked kind of confused, so I explained that I was using this shower because my leg hurt really badly and I wanted to sit. The girl interrupted me to ask if I was disabled, and I said no, so she cut me off and started shouting at me again. Finally the RA was just kind of like \"mind your business to her\" and told me to use the facilities that were meant for me but she just seemed anxious to leave so I don\\'t know. She left, and then the girl kind of gave me a dirty look and left too. \\n\\nIt\\'s been almost a week since then but I\\'ve been thinking about it a lot because it really rattled me. So, AITA?',\n",
       " \"AITA for reminding my relatives not to touch my stuff because of what they did last time?\\n\\nI live on the west coast and I regularly host my relatives from the east coast and Europe.  \\n\\nI love the back country here and showing it off to my relatives is one of my favorite things to do. I'm a geologist for a mining outfit so I have all kinds of equipment and training. \\n\\nMy uncle from Germany brought his family here before COVID and we had a great visit until one of my cousins started looking through my garage when we were packing up for a short camping trip. \\n\\nI made sure that they were all aware of the reasons for using bug spray. Beyond mosquitoes we have ticks in the area and long pants are the best way to avoid them but insect repellent is also a good idea. \\n\\nMy idiot cousin found my bear spray and thought she might like to try and give herself a nice coating to be safe from bears. \\n\\nIf you do not know, bear spray isn't meant to be worn as a topical application. You spray it at a bear's face to get it to bugger off. \\n\\nShe ended up coughing her lungs out and covered in all the milk products in my house. Plus some extra that my wife had to go buy. \\n\\nAnd every once in a while I will move something in my garage and catch a whiff of the capsaicin. \\n\\nMy cousin wants to come back for a visit now. I was reluctant. She asked me why and I reminded her of her last visit to my home four years ago. I asked if she had gotten better about keeping her hands to herself. \\n\\nI guess her and her boyfriend share the Facebook account that she contacted me from. He asked what I was talking about. So I told him what she did.  \\n\\nNow her dad is mad at me for bringing up a stupid mistake. She is mad at me because her boyfriend is laughing at her. And my wife is mad at me for sharing family information. \\n\\nI wasn't trying to embarrass her. I just hate how much time and effort I had to put in to clean my garage and my gear.\",\n",
       " 'AITA for keys getting washed & dried?\\n\\nMy boyfriend left his car keys (including the spare) in his pockets obviously unknowingly, and I did the laundry as usual. He couldn’t find his keys anywhere and the dryer just finished so I went to take the clothes out and lo and behold two car keys loose spinning around! His first sentence out of his mouth “so you didn’t check my pockets before washing the clothes?” Obviously with anger in his voice. My jaw literally dropped and now he’s saying I don’t take responsibility for anything.

Both my cousin and aunt started laughing they know exactly how my dad is. He asked what? and why would I say that?

I mean I know kids are kids and my kids are no where near perfect but I have honestly never seen such behaviour. There are two girls age 5 and 9 and they are the most disrespectful children I have ever met. This I can ignore as I don’t usually let them come in the house as I have two smaller kids inside and they insist on either trying to yank my 6 month old out of my wife’s hand smash on all my lizard tanks and pick up and carry my 2 year old around who absolutely hates being carried. But now down to the part that is really frustrating me. Since hanging out with these girls my 5 year old has starting treating my wife the same way these girls treat there grandma and mom. No respect, straight up ignoring her, being rude and just a general sense that he doesn’t have to listen to anything she says. I’m at the point where I don’t want him hanging around with them any more but there mother and grandmother quite often send them out and tell them to come play with my kids.\n",

I let the girls know today that they are not welcome to just come in to our back yard uninvited and if they do they will be sent home. As for disciplining my son he’s generally a really good kid and so I don’t believe that harsh punishment is necessary we have sat him down after school and had a talk with him about how his behaviour is being affected but the girls next door and he seams to understand why we are doing what we are doing. He is however grounded from going out to play with those girls for a week and if after that week his behaviour has improved we will revisit the idea of supervised visits with them and see where it goes. Thanks for taking the time to weigh in and let me know your thoughts!\n",

      "I (20f) am not conventionally pretty. I know that. I have crooked teeth which I couldn't afford to have fixed. I don't have curves, and I'm severely flat chested. When I was in high school, I've already grown to accept that I'm not attractive. I felt how extremely unattractive I am when I was was walking with this pretty friend of mine and she'd always get approached for her number while I was pretty much ignored. I never wanted to text any of them anyway, but that was still a very clear sign that I am indeed unattractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently (thanks to my love for Kpop), I've really been into make up. Obviously, I don't have money to pay for expensive brands but I'll make do of what I can afford in our local brands. I started using make up on a daily basis whenever I'd go to school and do my part-time job and for the first time in my life, I started getting compliments for my looks. Call me shallow, but it really boosted my confidence. It made it easier for me to make friends with other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now onto the situation, I was already getting ready for a relative's birthday celebration and naturally, I wanted to look nice. It was the first time in my life that I wouldn't look like the ugly duckling in our group photo with my cousins. I was excited!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, my excitement was ruined when my mother made a comment while I was getting ready. There's no accurate English translation to the word she said but basically, she asked me not to be \"too pretty\" or else my cousin Jenny will get insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the thing, Jenny (21f) is conventionally pretty. She is so pretty, she even joined a pageant in her teens. But, I also knew how insecure she could get at times. She would often bad mouth a few of our other cousins to me just because they wear more expensive clothes than her. In a way, I know that my mother's word wouldn't be far from the truth since Jenny doesn't really like it when someone else \"one upped\" her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally don't care about what she would feel. Honestly, I just really don't want to stand out in the picture for all the wrong reasons. But what really bothers me is how my mother is prioritizing my cousin's insecurities over mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "All my life, I've always been insecure of how I would look beside my cousins. I'll always be the one who's wearing old and unfashionable clothes while they all wear new and branded ones. I never said a thing about that since I don't want my parents to feel bad about our socio-economic status. But, still, It really made me feel self conscious whenever I would sit next to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays, I don't have to feel the same way again because I know how to carry myself by finding clothes from secondhand stores and of course by wearing (light and natural looking) make up. I now have the confidence to lbe next to them but apparently, my mother doesn't like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't end up attending my relative's birthday because of it, but that's not what this post is for.\n",
